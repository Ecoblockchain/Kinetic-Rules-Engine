INTRODUCTION

This document describes how to install KRE. 

* KRE runs as an Apache module. Thus, installing Apache is a key to making it work.
* KRE is a mod_perl Apache module. Thus, there are a lot of Perl pre-requisites.

TODO

* The installation is too complex. This ought to be easier.
* We assume Centos, Fedora, or Redat. We should test and expand instructions to include other Linux distros.
* The installation *has* to be done in the /web/lib/perl directory. This restriction should be removed
* The installation depends on a custom build of Apache. Can we use the stock distribution?
