We use [HuBoard](https://huboard.com/) to organize and track issues. Once you have access to KRE you should be able to use HuBoard to watch issues. Anything in the *Ready* column should be ready to work. Please assign yourself and move it to the ready column. Do your work in a fork of the project and submit your changes as a pull request. 

The following process is recommended:

1. Fork the project and work on your own repository

2. Be sure to create tests that show the problem. The KRE test suite is quite good and we rely on it to ensure that changes don't cause existing features to work.

3. Submit a pull request to this project from your project with the changes.

Your pull request will be more easily integrated if you

1. include tests

2. be responsive to questions on the pull request

3. ensure you aren't duplicating some other work
